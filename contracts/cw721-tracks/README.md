## CW721-tracks

A modified implementation of CW721 standard that allows permissionless minting of NFTs, and stores metadata specific to tracks.

All other functionalities are identical to a standard CW721 contract.

For reference, see [CW721 with on-chain metadata](https://github.com/terran6/nft-on-terra/blob/master/contracts/cw721-metadata-onchain/README.md).
